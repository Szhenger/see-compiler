# SeeComplier: A Beginner-Friendly C/C++ Compiler 

## Description

This is **SeeCompiler**, a readable and modular C/C++ compiler that translates a verified subset of the C Programming Language into a sequence of x86 Assembly Instructions. It is designed with a focus on clarity, traceability, and ease of understanding. Built for learning and exploration, the compiler exposes each compilation subroutine — from lexical analysis to code generation — through clean interfaces and educational debug output. However, performance matters too. It is engineered for fast compilation, low memory usage, and modularity — enabling future parallelism and adaptability.
